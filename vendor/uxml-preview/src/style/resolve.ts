/**
 * The cascade: what style actually applies to each element.

 * cheap and cannot go stale.
 *
 * Precedence, highest first:
 *   1. the element's own `style` attribute
 *   2. matching rules, by specificity, ties going to the later rule
 *   3. inheritance from the parent, for the properties that inherit
 *   4. the USS default, which this module does not fill in
 *
 * Anything absent from the result is at its default. Not writing defaults keeps
 * the map small and keeps the default table in one place — the renderer, which

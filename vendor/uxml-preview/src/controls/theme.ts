/**
 * Unity's control defaults, as far as we have measured them.
 *
 * Unity ships a theme stylesheet that gives controls their own margin, padding
 * and border before any author USS runs. This renderer supplied none of it, so
 * every Button sat 3px left and 1px high of where Unity puts it — invisible on
 * one button and compounding across a row.
 *
 * **Only measured values live here.** Every declaration below was derived from
 * a Unity layout dump in tests/golden/unity/, and adding `Button`'s margin
 * moved all five Button cases from 18 mismatched values to zero. Values read
 * from Unity's source instead would look identical in this file while being
 * wrong in a way no test could see: they would not appear in the unmeasured
 * list, so they would quietly pass for ground truth.
 *
 * Two kinds of measurement feed this file, and the second was a long time
 * coming. Geometry comes from the coordinate dumps. `-unity-text-align` cannot:
 * where a glyph sits inside a box does not move the box, so no dump can ever
 * see it. It came from the Step 6 eye check — Unity centres a Button's label
 * and this renderer had it at the top left, which is visible the moment the two
 * screenshots sit side by side and invisible in 368 compared numbers.
 *
 * `opacity` on `:disabled` came from the same screenshots, but by sampling
 * pixels rather than looking. Unity's disabled Drop button is rgb(41,50,67);
 * the base colour rgb(58,74,104) composited at half over the footer's
 * rgb(24,26,31) is (41, 50, 67.5) — all three channels exact. That arithmetic
 * is the evidence, and it is why the value is 0.5 and not a number that merely
 * looked about right.
 *
 * Getting there took two wrong turns worth recording. First the author's
 * `Button:disabled` rule was blamed for not applying — it genuinely does not,
 * because `#DropButton` outranks it, in both engines. Then Unity was accused of
 * ranking state rules above specificity, and `state-vs-id` and `state-vs-inline`
 * refuted that: Unity answers 40 to both, exactly as this cascade already did.
 * The dimming was never about the cascade at all.
 *
 * What is deliberately absent, and why:
 *
 *   - `Label` — measured, and it has no default margin. `inherit-vs-direct`
 *     puts an explicitly-sized Label at the origin of a sized parent, and Unity
 *     reports x=0 y=0. Nothing to add is a result, not an omission.
 *   - padding, border, font — invisible to the cases we have. Every compared
 *     element is explicitly sized, and USS is border-box, so padding and border
 *     do not move the outer rectangle. They are unmeasured, so they are not here.
 *   - `Label`'s text alignment — the eye check could not separate it from the
 *     box at this size. Unmeasured, so absent.
 *
 * The class names were a separate claim from the values, and are now measured
 * too. `unity-button` came from Unity's documented `Button.ussClassName`, which
 * the margin dumps said nothing about — they proved the spacing, not the
 * selector delivering it. The golden case `theme-class-hook` was written to
 * settle exactly that, and Unity answered on 2026-08-05: a `.unity-button` rule
 * in author USS reaches a bare `<ui:Button>`, sizing it 120×40 in both engines.
 * The selector below is therefore measured, not assumed.

 * from here carry `evidence: 'documented'` so an editor can say which it is

 *

 * without evidence is how the `.unity-button` selector became a hypothesis

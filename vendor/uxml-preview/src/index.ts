   *
   * Used for both ways a document can name a stylesheet — `@import` inside USS,
   * and `<Style src="…">` inside UXML. Both quote paths like
   * `project://database/Assets/UI/base.uss`, which only the host application
   * knows how to turn into file contents, and there is no reason for a host to
   * implement that lookup twice.
   *
   * `from` is the URL of the stylesheet containing this import — exactly the
   * string this hook received as `url` when that containing sheet was itself
   * resolved, unmodified. `null` for a `<Style src="…">` reference, which is
   * not contained in any stylesheet. A relative `@import` cannot be resolved
   * without this: `a.uss` importing `"b.uss"` means a path relative to `a.uss`,
   * not to the UXML document, and there is no other way for the host to learn
   * `a.uss`'s own URL at the point it resolves `b.uss`.
   *
   * Non-breaking: this is an added argument, not a replacement one, so an
   * existing one-argument callback keeps working unchanged.
   *
   * Relative imports are deduplicated by `(url, from)`, so two parent sheets
   * may resolve the same spelling to different files. Root-fixed URLs —
   * `project://…` or a path beginning with `/` — are deduplicated by URL alone.

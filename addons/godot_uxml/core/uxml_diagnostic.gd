class_name UxmlDiagnostic
extends RefCounted
## A diagnostic is a plain Dictionary; this class only builds and formats them.
##
## Keys:
##   kind    - machine-readable category (see below)
##   message - human-readable explanation
##   file    - document or stylesheet path the diagnostic belongs to ("" if none)
##   line    - 1-based line in that file's source text
##   column  - 1-based column
##   offset  - character offset the line/column were computed from
##
## Kinds emitted by milestone 1:
##   malformed             - broken UXML/USS syntax that was recovered from
##   unsupported-control   - element tag with no Godot mapping (children kept)
##   unsupported-feature   - known USS/UXML machinery out of scope (@media, ...)
##   unsupported-selector  - a selector form the cascade cannot honor; the whole
##                           rule is ignored rather than treated as universal
##   unsupported-property  - a declaration property outside the supported subset
##   unsupported-attribute - an element attribute the addon does not consume
##   unresolved-var        - var() reference with no usable fallback / a cycle
##   import-unresolved     - a <Style src> or @import that could not be loaded
##   import-cycle          - an @import cycle (already-loaded sheets dedupe)
##   missing-file          - a referenced file does not exist under the root
##   path-outside-root     - a reference that escapes the project root
##   malformed-reference   - a reference that is not a usable path at all
##   version-dependent     - behavior Unity defines but versions may shift (:root)
##   template-not-declared - <Instance template="X"> with no <Template name="X">
##   template-cycle        - an <Instance> that refers back to a template on
##                           the current expansion path (left empty)
##   template-depth-exceeded - <Instance> nesting deeper than 32 (left empty)
##   override-ignored      - AttributeOverrides class/name/style (Unity ignores)
##   override-target-missing - AttributeOverrides element-name matched nothing
##   binding-failed        - a data binding that cannot run: unknown property,
##                           unresolved path, a target the control does not
##                           have, an unknown converter group (runtime)

## 1-based (line, column) of `offset` inside `source`.

## cascades that warn on many elements of a large document.

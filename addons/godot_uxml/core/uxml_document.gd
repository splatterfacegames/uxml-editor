extends RefCounted
## The semantic document: a parsed UXML tree plus every stylesheet it pulls in.
##
## This is the input the style resolver consumes. It deliberately holds only
## what the files said — computed styles are produced per resolve() call and
## never stored here.
##
## Sheets are flat in load order; `style_roots` records which subtree each
## entry sheet is attached to (`<Style src>` scopes to its parent element).
## A rule only applies to elements inside its sheet's scope.
